# ALMA

## Overview
ALMA aims to solve the problems of the social structure dominated by the Internet by providing a system that allows for self-expression in both physical and cyber societies. Specifically, it seeks to enable individuals to identify themselves and define an organizational entity containing an ecosystem of value. By harmonizing these entities, people can build communities that differ from the current societal norms, reflecting their personal ideologies.
ALMA, meaning "soul" in Spanish and "source of life" in Latin, represents a self that is not regulated by states or companies but is bonded with one's own soul. Ultimately, ALMA aims to surpass the Internet, covering the entire planet, allowing all humanity to choose groups to participate in where they feel comfortable and express their values.
